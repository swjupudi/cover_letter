We are using chat gpt's LLM model to personalize a cover letter based on the job description and user's resume. The user's resume is in the pdf format. 

Prerequisites to execute the code:

1. python >= 3.10
2. Install poetry >= 1.4 version
3. Run `poetry install` in the python environment of your choice
 
To execute the code:
1. Make sure you are in the right conda environment where the project is installed
2. Type in the command `createcl` and press enter
3. Copy the job description and press enter

Note: 
It could take a while for the cover letter to be displayed in the terminal. For faster responses, consider changing the model to chatgpt 4
